Implementing multi-threading library

This include two libraries using:
1. One-one model
2. Many-one model

Data Structures:
---------------
Double ended Queue for the imeplemntation of 
FIFO scheduling of threads.

To Run using One-one model:
---------------------------
1. Go to "one-one" folder.
2. Create test.c file and write your code in it.
3. Include "../thread.h" in your test.c file.
4. Run command "make".
5. Run "./test".

To Run using Many-one model:
---------------------------
1. Go to "many-one" folder.
2. Create test.c file and write your code in it.
3. Include "../thread.h" in your test.c file.
4. Run command "make".
5. Run "./test".
